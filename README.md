# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
This project is designed to search through the reviews from the automotive section of amazon to determine if there is any bias in the number of stars given vs if the review was paid/unpaid.
</br>
The data is filtered before it undergoes analysis:
- The data is filtered to only include reviews with 20 or more votes.
- The data is then filtered to only include 50% and above for helpful votes.
- The data was then separated into:
    - Paid reviews
    - Unpaid reviews

Three determinations were then drawn about the data.
- How many reviews exist in each category?
- How many reviews were 5 star?
- What percentage of the 5 star reviews are paid vs unpaid?
